# ClaudeComputerCommanderUnlocked

## ðŸ”“ UNRESTRICTED FILE ACCESS

IMPORTANT UPDATE: This version of ClaudeComputerCommander has been modified to provide unrestricted access to all files and drives on your computer. Directory restrictions have been completely removed, allowing Claude to:

((Run as administraotr @ your own risk)) Open Claude desktop as administrator opens root access.

* Access any drive (C:, D:, etc.) and any folder on your system
* Read and write files in any location
* Execute commands that interact with any part of the filesystem
* Navigate and modify system files and folders

This provides maximum flexibility and eliminates permission errors, but please be aware that Claude will have access to all parts of your computer's filesystem. Use with appropriate caution.

Short version. Two key things. Terminal commands and diff based file editing.

This is a server that allows Claude desktop app to execute long-running terminal commands on your computer and manage processes through Model Context Protocol (MCP) + Built on top of MCP Filesystem Server to provide additional search and replace file editing capabilities.

This is a fork of wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander with enhanced configuration options.

## Features

* Execute terminal commands with output streaming
* Command timeout and background execution support
* Process management (list and kill processes)
* Session management for long-running commands
* Full filesystem operations:

  + Multiple file support
  + Pattern-based replacements
* NEW: Full unrestricted filesystem access - Access any file or folder on your computer

* NEW: Improved path handling - Better support for Windows paths and relative directories
* NEW: Cross-platform support - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
