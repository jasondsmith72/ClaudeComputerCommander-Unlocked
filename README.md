Short version. Two key things. Terminal commands and diff based file editing.

This is a server that allows Claude desktop app to execute long-running terminal commands on your computer and manage processes through Model Context Protocol (MCP) + Built on top of [MCP Filesystem Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) to provide additional search and replace file editing capabilities.

This is a fork of [wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander](https://github.com/wonderwhy-er/ClaudeComputerCommander) with enhanced configuration options.

## üîì UNRESTRICTED FILE ACCESS

**IMPORTANT UPDATE**: This version of ClaudeComputerCommander has been modified to provide **unrestricted access to all files and drives** on your computer. Directory restrictions have been completely removed, allowing Claude to:

((**Run as administraotr @ your own risk**))

- Access any drive (C:, D:, etc.) and any folder on your system
- Read and write files in any location 
- Execute commands that interact with any part of the filesystem
- Navigate and modify system files and folders

This provides maximum flexibility and eliminates permission errors, but please be aware that Claude will have access to all parts of your computer's filesystem. Use with appropriate caution.

## Features

- Execute terminal commands with output streaming
- Command timeout and background execution support
- Process management (list and kill processes)
- Session management for long-running commands
- Full filesystem operations:
  - Read/write files
  - Create/list directories
  - Move files/directories
  - Search files
  - Get file metadata
  - Code editing capabilities:
  - Surgical text replacements for small changes
  - Full file rewrites for major changes
  - Multiple file support
  - Pattern-based replacements
- **NEW: Full unrestricted filesystem access** - Access any file or folder on your computer
- **NEW: Command-based fallbacks** - Even when direct file access fails, commands will be used as a fallback
- **NEW: Improved path handling** - Better support for Windows paths and relative directories
- **NEW: Cross-platform support** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Installation
First, ensure you've downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) and you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Option 1: Custom Setup (Recommended)
This method is best if you don't have permissions to directly modify the Claude config file or prefer a guided approach:

1. Clone the repository:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jasondsmith72/ClaudeComputerCommander.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory 
```powershell
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
```

3. Install dependencies:
```powershell
npm install
```

4. Build the project:
```powershell
npm run build
```

5. Run the appropriate setup script based on your needs:
```powershell
# For Windows with automatic configuration:
npm run setup:windows

# For guided manual setup (works on any platform):
npm run setup:custom

# For standard setup (requires write access to Claude config):
npm run setup
```

6. Follow any on-screen instructions provided by the setup script.

7. Restart Claude if it's running.


### Option 2: Add to claude_desktop_config manually
Add this entry to your claude_desktop_config.json (on Windows, found at %APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@jasondsmith72/desktop-commander"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Restart Claude if running.

### Option 3: Use the all-in-one fix script (For unrestricted access)

If you want to ensure full unrestricted access to all files and drives:

1. After cloning the repository and navigating to the directory:
```powershell
node fix-all.js
```

This script will:
- Configure unrestricted file access
- Install all dependencies and build the project
- Update Claude Desktop's configuration
- Run tests to verify access works correctly

## Uninstallation

To uninstall ClaudeComputerCommander, you have two options:

### Option 1: Using the uninstall script (Recommended)

If you have the repository locally:
```powershell
cd ClaudeComputerCommander
npm run uninstall
```

If you've installed it globally:
```powershell
npx @jasondsmith72/desktop-commander uninstall
```

This will:
1. Create a backup of your Claude configuration file
2. Remove all references to desktopCommander from the configuration
3. Log the changes made for reference

### Option 2: Manual uninstallation

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Remove the `desktopCommander` entry from the `mcpServers` section.

3. Restart Claude Desktop.

4. If you installed the package globally, uninstall it:
   ```powershell
   npm uninstall -g @jasondsmith72/desktop-commander
   ```

## Unrestricted File Access

This version of ClaudeComputerCommander has been modified to provide **completely unrestricted access to all files and drives**. 

Key aspects of the unrestricted access:

1. **No Directory Limitations**: There are no restrictions on which directories Claude can access
2. **All Drives Accessible**: All drive letters (C:, D:, etc.) are accessible on Windows systems
3. **Root Access**: The root directory (/) is accessible on Unix-like systems
4. **Command Fallbacks**: If direct file operations fail, the system automatically falls back to using command execution

The unrestricted access is provided through several mechanisms:

1. Configuration that allows all drives and paths
2. Modified source code that bypasses all directory validation
3. Command-based fallbacks that use PowerShell or shell commands when direct file operations fail
4. Environmental variables that signal unrestricted mode to the system

## Usage

The server provides these tool categories:

### Terminal Tools
- `execute_command`: Run commands with configurable timeout
- `read_output`: Get output from long-running commands
- `force_terminate`: Stop running command sessions
- `list_sessions`: View active command sessions
- `list_processes`: View system processes
- `kill_process`: Terminate processes by PID
- `block_command`/`unblock_command`: Manage command blacklist

### Filesystem Tools
- `read_file`/`write_file`: File operations
- `create_directory`/`list_directory`: Directory management  
- `move_file`: Move/rename files
- `search_files`: Pattern-based file search
- `get_file_info`: File metadata
- `list_allowed_directories`: View which directories the server can access

### Edit Tools
- `edit_block`: Apply surgical text replacements (best for changes <20% of file size)
- `write_file`: Complete file rewrites (best for large changes >20% or when edit_block fails)

Search/Replace Block Format:
```
filepath.ext
<<<<<<< SEARCH
existing code to replace
=======
new code to insert
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Example:
```
src/main.js
<<<<<<< SEARCH
console.log("old message");
=======
console.log("new message");
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

## Handling Long-Running Commands

For commands that may take a while:

1. `execute_command` returns after timeout with initial output
2. Command continues in background
3. Use `read_output` with PID to get new output
4. Use `force_terminate` to stop if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues setting up or using the MCP server:

1. Check that Claude Desktop is properly installed and has been run at least once
2. Verify that the claude_desktop_config.json file exists and is properly formatted
3. Make sure you have the required permissions to modify the config file
4. Restart Claude Desktop after making changes to the config
5. If you're having file access issues, try using the `fix-all.js` script to enable unrestricted access
6. Check the log files for detailed error messages:
   - `server.log`: General operation logs
   - `file-operations.log`: Detailed file operation logs
   - `test-unrestricted.log`: Results from access testing

### Access Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing permission issues:

1. Run the `fix-all.js` script to apply all unrestricted access fixes
2. Use the `test-unrestricted.js` script to verify access works correctly
3. Check if `execute_command` can access files even when direct file operations fail
4. Try running the application with administrator privileges
